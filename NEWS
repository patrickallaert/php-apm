APM 2.0.4        ?? Jun 2015
----------------------------
Fixed:
- Temporary buffer not freed when generating stacktraces.
- Arguments in stacktraces dumped with a bigger depth than what is configured with apm.dump_max_depth.

APM 2.0.3        18 May 2015
----------------------------
Fixed:
- Double initialization of request data.
  This could lead to data being present twice in DBs (reproducible with both SQLite and MySQL enabled).
Changed:
- Default value of apm.dump_max_depth decreased to 1.
  With today's application complexity, the amount of data collected in stacktraces
  including arguments can lead to several thousands of MiB of memory consumed.
  We recommend increasing this value with care.
- Weird things could happen when changing 'apm.enabled' during a request. It doesn't make much sense to support
  in request activation/deactivation. 'apm.enabled' is therefor now PHP_INI_SYSTEM.

APM 2.0.2        09 Mar 2015
----------------------------
Fixed:
- Compilation issue on non ZTS setup

APM 2.0.1        09 Mar 2015
----------------------------
Fixed:
- #10: Bad configure message (thx @RemiCollet)
- #11: Bad version reported (thx @RemiCollet)
- #13: ZTS build is broken (thx @RemiCollet)
- APM not working with XDebug
  If Xdebug is enabled as in xdebug_enable() or xdebug.default_enable, APM error callback will not be called.
  Use xdebug.default_enable=0 or xdebug_disable() to go through APM error handling.

Improved:
- #12: Installation of files via pecl install
- StatsD driver (thanks @0livier for the discovery!)

Changed:
- Web frontend located on its own repository: https://github.com/patrickallaert/php-apm-web

APM 2.0.0        20 Feb 2015
----------------------------
New drivers:
- StatsD
- Socket

Added:
- Per-driver option 'apm.&lt;storage driver&gt;_store_silenced_events that lets you toggle whether to store silenced (@-ed) errors (thanks Mathieu Kooiman (@mathieuk))
- apm.*_exception_mode configuration to control exception collection
- Auto creation of SQLite and MariaDB/MySQL schemas
- Stats:
  - User and System CPU time
  - Memory Peak Usage
  - HTTP response code
- 'application_id' field to categorize the issues per application/server/environment/...
- Support for compilation on Ubuntu (thanks Olivier Garcia (@0livier))

Changed:
- Deep refactoring:
  - New DB schema
  - No more native functions, retrieval of data is directly made in PHP
- SQLite drivder attempts to create the directory structure by himself
- Renamed 'slow request' to 'stats'
- Connect to MySQL once and reconnect if needed
- Small UI improvements
- Avoiding int / uint conversion
- MariaDB/MySQL driver activated by default

Fixed:
- Parse error test failing on PHP 5.4
- Possible segfault with APM_DEBUG used outside RINIT/RSHUTDOWN phases
- Missing disconnect from SQLite DB if changed with ini_set()
- Too few arguments to sprintf() with MariaDB/MySQL backend
- Possible segfault with PHP 5.5
- Segmentation fault with "zend_mm_heap corrupted" message.
- Missing zval reference incrementing
- Out of memory error in backtrace generation
- Removed hard-coded limit of 64kB json data
- Do not activate silence handler if APM is not enabled
- Some compiler warnings
- Incorrect status propagation for PHP_RSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION
- Several memory leaks

Removed:
- Deffered processing (can't be easily implemented in a generic and driver
  agnostic way. Depending on the drivers, some deffered processing will
  happen inside them.)
- Reference SQL files, see source code for that ;-)
